# Quizzical Scrimba FrontEnd Module 10 - React Basics

This is a quiz application that uses a restful API from https://opentdb.com/api_config.php . There is no API key required.

See [Demo](https://get-quizzical.netlify.app/)

# Functionality
- The initial page is used to set the the trivia in terms of category, difficulty and quiz length.
- The quiz then loads and the user selects their choices and is not allowed to submit the quiz until an answer is selected for each question
- the 

# Libaries that have been used
- React Router
- React Spinner whilst page is loading
- React Context to reduce prop drilling



# Stretch goals
- I coded this using typescript. My typescript experience is limited but I would like to use it more
- Used React Spinner whilst the Quizapp is loading
- React Router- allows navigation through routing rather than state - this is better for page loading. 

# Further Stretch Goals/General Improvements
- To refactor the CSS to make maintenance easier
- To add a dark mode as I have done with several of my react apps 
- To improve the design of the initial trivia screen
- To refactor the Global Context into smaller components
